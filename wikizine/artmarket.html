        <h1>Art Market</h1>
            <p>Basquiat sold his first painting to singer Debbie Harry for $200 in 1981.[56] Advised by Italian artist Sandro Chia, gallerist Emilio Mazzoli purchased ten of Basquiat's works for $10,000 and held an exhibition at his gallery in Modena in May 1981.[24] Spurred by the Neo-expressionism art boom, his work was in great demand by 1982, which is considered his most valuable year.[164] A majority of his highest-selling paintings at auction date to 1982. Recalling that year, Basquiat said, "I had some money; I made the best paintings ever."[24] His paintings were priced at $5,000 to $10,000 in 1983—lowered from the range of $10,000 to $15,000 when he joined Mary Boone's gallery to reflect what she felt was consistent with those of other artists in her gallery.[198] In 1984, it was reported that in two years his work appreciated in value by 500%.[199] In the mid-1980s, Basquiat was earning $1.4 million a year as an artist.[99] By 1985, his paintings were selling for $10,000 to $25,000 each.[24] Basquiat's rise to fame in the international art market landed him on the cover of The New York Times Magazine in 1985, which was unprecedented for a young African-American artist.[200] <br><br>

Since Basquiat's death in 1988, the market for his work has developed steadily—in line with overall art market trends—with a dramatic peak in 2007 when, at the height of the art market boom, the global auction volume for his work was over $115 million. Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of Christie's, is quoted describing Basquiat's market as "two-tiered ... The most coveted material is rare, generally dating from the best period, 1981–83."[201] Until 2002, the highest amount paid for an original work of Basquiat's was $3.3 million for Self-Portrait (1982), sold at Christie's in 1998.[202] In 2002, Basquiat's Profit I (1982) was sold at Christie's by drummer Lars Ulrich of the heavy metal band Metallica for $5.5 million.[203] The proceedings of the auction were documented in the 2004 film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.[204] <br><br>

In June 2002, New York artist Alfredo Martinez was charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with attempting to deceive two art dealers by selling them $185,000 worth of fake Basquiat drawings.[205] The charges against Martinez, which landed him in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correction Center for 21 months, involved a scheme to sell drawings he copied from authentic artworks, accompanied by forged certificates of authenticity.[206] Martinez claimed he got away with selling fake Basquiat drawings for 18 years.[207][208] <br><br>

In 2007, Basquiat's painting Hannibal (1982) was seized by federal authorities as part of an embezzlement scheme by convicted Brazilian money launderer and former banker Edemar Cid Ferreira.[209] Ferreira had purchased the painting with illegally acquired funds while he controlled Banco Santos in Brazil.[209] It was shipped to a Manhattan warehouse, via the Netherlands, with a false shipping invoice stating it was worth $100.[210] The painting was later sold at Sotheby's for $13.1 million.[211] <br><br>

Between 2007 and 2012, the price of Basquiat's work continued to steadily increase up to $16.3 million.[212][213][214] The sale of Untitled (1981) for $20.1 million in 2012 elevated his market to a new stratosphere.[215] Soon other works in his oeuvre outpaced that record. Another work, Untitled (1981), depicting a fisherman, sold for $26.4 million in 2012.[216] In 2013, Dustheads (1982) sold for $48.8 million at Christie's.[217] Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa purchased Untitled (1982), depicting a devil-like figure, for $57.3 million at Christie's in 2017.[218] He sold the painting for $85 million at Phillips in 2022.[219] Maezawa also purchased Basquiat's Untitled (1982), a powerful depiction of a black skull with red and yellow rivulets, for a record-setting $110.5 million in May 2017.[220] It is the second highest price ever paid at an auction for artwork by an American artist.[221][222]<br><br>

In 2018, Flexible (1984) sold for $45.3 million, becoming Basquiat's first post-1983 painting to surpass the $20 million mark.[223] In June 2020, Untitled (Head) (1982), sold for $15.2 million; a record for a Sotheby's online sale and a record for a Basquiat work on paper.[224] In July 2020, Loïc Gouzer's Fair Warning app announced that an untitled drawing on paper sold for $10.8 million, which is a record high for an in-app purchase.[225] Earlier that year, American businessman Ken Griffin purchased Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump (1982) for upwards of $100 million from art collector Peter Brant.[226][227] In March 2021, Warrior (1982) sold for $41.8 million at Christie's in Hong Kong, which is the most expensive Western work of art sold at auction in Asia.[228][229] In May 2021, In This Case (1983) sold for $93.1 million at Christie's in New York.[230] Later that year, Donut Revenge (1982) sold for $20.9 million at Christie's in Hong Kong.[231] In 2022, Sugar Ray Robinson (1982) sold for $32.6 million at Christie's in New York.[232] In 2023, El Gran Espectaculo (The Nile) (1983) sold for $67.1 million at Christie's, and Self-Portrait as a Heel (Part Two) (1982) sold for $42 million at Sotheby's in New York.[233][234]

        <h1>Forgeries</h1>
        <p>
          In 1994, three paintings displayed as Basquiats at the FIAC were revealed to be fakes.[235] In 2007 Christie's was sued in Manhattan Supreme Court for allegedly selling a fake Basquiat.[236][237] Christie's rejected the charge[238] but the suit proceeded.[239][240] In 2020 a Los Angeles man, Philip Bennet Righter, plead guilty to art fraud after trying to sell forged paintings by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat.[241] Also in 2020, in France, an exhibition of drawings attributed to Basquiat at the Volcano gallery in Nuits-Saint-Georges was disputed.[235][242]<br><br>

In February 2022, the Orlando Museum of Art mounted the controversial exhibition Heroes & Monsters, which consisted of 25 cardboard works that were claimed to have been sold by Basquiat directly to screenwriter Thad Mumford in 1982, and then placed in storage, where they remained until being rediscovered in 2012.[243][244][245] The paintings were seized in a raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in June 2022.[246] The New York Times obtained an affidavit that revealed Mumford signed a declaration in the presence of federal agents stating that "at no time in the 1980s or any other time did I meet with Jean-Michel Basquiat, and at no time did I acquire or purchase any paintings from him."[247] Los Angeles auctioneer Michael Barzman confessed to creating a suite of 25 Basquiat forgeries that wound up at the Orlando Museum of Art and was sentenced to community service and probation.[248][249][250]<br><br>

In 2023, Florida art dealer Daniel Elie Bouaziz was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for a money laundering scheme to sell counterfeit contemporary artworks, including pieces purportedly by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and Banksy.[251] </p>
<h1>Authentication committee</h1>
            <p>The authentication committee of the estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat was formed by the Robert Miller Gallery, the gallery that was assigned to handle Basquiat's estate after his death, in part to wage battle against the growing number of fakes and forgeries in the Basquiat market.[252] The cost of the committee's opinion was $100.[252] The committee was headed by Basquiat's father Gérard Basquiat. Members varied depending on who was available at the time when a piece was being authenticated, but they have included the curators and gallerists Diego Cortez, Jeffrey Deitch, Annina Nosei, John Cheim, Richard Marshall, Fred Hoffman, and publisher Larry Warsh.[253][254] <br><br>

In 2008, the authentication committee was sued by collector Gerard De Geer, who claimed the committee breached its contract by refusing to offer an opinion on the authenticity of the painting Fuego Flores (1983).[255] After the lawsuit was dismissed, the committee ruled the work genuine.[256] In January 2012, the committee announced that after eighteen years it would dissolve in September of that year and no longer consider applications.[254]
            </p>
             <h1>Sexuality</h1>
            <p>Basquiat had romantic relationships with many women, including Madonna.[257][258] Although he never publicly identified as bisexual, several of his friends have stated that he had sexual relationships with men.[259][260] Basquiat's former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk described his sexual interest as "not monochromatic. It did not rely on visual stimulation, such as a pretty girl. It was a very rich multichromatic sexuality. He was attracted to people for all different reasons. They could be boys, girls, thin, fat, pretty, ugly ... He was attracted to intelligence more than anything and to pain."[261] <br><br>

Biographer Phoebe Hoban stated that Basquiat's first sexual experiences were homosexual while he was a minor in Puerto Rico; he had been orally raped by a barber dressed in drag, then he got involved with a deejay.[20] Art critic Rene Ricard, who helped launch Basquiat's career, said that Basquiat was into everything and had "turned tricks" in Condado when he lived in Puerto Rico.[262] As a teenager, Basquiat told a friend that he worked as a prostitute on 42nd Street in Manhattan when he ran away from home.[26] Andy Warhol said Basquiat had refused to go with him and Keith Haring to Rounds, a gay hustler bar,[263] because it brought back bad memories of when he was hustling.[264]
